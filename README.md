# seaborn
This project focuses on cleaning, analyzing, and understanding data to find meaningful patterns and insights. It involves preparing raw data by handling missing values, correcting errors, and organizing the data so it can be properly analyzed.
After cleaning, the project uses exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations to study relationships between different variables and to understand how they influence outcomes. The goal is to turn raw data into useful information that can support decision-making or further modeling.
